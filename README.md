# NDT Client Chrome Extension

This is an experimental HTML5 based Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) client that uses the Chrome Socket API to connect as a normal TCP client to a NDT server.

To use this client you must simply install the ndt-chromapp.crx in your Chrome browser by drag and drop or in Chrome OS with a double click. The client is then available to use as an app in Chrome.

* The code is based on the wsNDT client that is availble here: https://github.com/bchase78/wsndt

* This package version can be installed in Chrome > v33
