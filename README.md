# NDT Client Chrome Extension

This is an experimental HTML5 based Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) client that uses the Chrome Socket API to connect as a normal TCP client to a NDT server.

To use this client you must install the ndt-chromeapp.crx in your Chrome browser. To do this 

* navigate to: chrome://extensions/
* drag and drop ndt-chromeapp.crx on the browser window
* click ok to install 

The client is then available to use as an app in Chrome.

* The client code is based on the wsNDT client that is availble here: https://github.com/bchase78/wsndt

* This package version can only be installed in Chrome > v33
